This Interactive Learning platform utilises RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LLM (Large Language Models) to deliver personalized education. Teachers design exercises (title, question, answer, PDF reference) via an intuitive interface, building a structured library. Students engage by solving exercises, with RAG processing uploaded PDFs into a vector database to retrieve content directly tied to the learning material, ensuring accuracy. LLMs analyze responses, generating dynamic hints and explanations tailored to the studentâ€™s progress, adapting feedback as their understanding evolves.
